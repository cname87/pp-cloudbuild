# Project Information

Date: 30-Dec-21

These docs refer to the github repository 'pp-cloudbuild which is the project-perform application running on Google Cloudbuild.
The vscode project is called 'project-perform-cb', docker images are stored in 'pp-backend-bcb' and 'pp-frontend-cb', and secrets are stored in 'project-perform-cb-secrets'.

Notes:

- Front-end and backend tests are not running or complete.
- I have not set up to use Skaffold for development.
- I have not set up to use GCP Cloudbuild for automated builds.
